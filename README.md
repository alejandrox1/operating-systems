# operating-systems

Welcome to yet another repo aiming to help you get started with some
interesting and possibly complicated area of technology.
This one project will be all about anything related to operating systems,
mostly on kernels, and some tangentially related topics that will let you dive
deep into the silicon we all use fo very often.

If you are here, then you might have already discovered hundreds of sites,
posts, and articles about OS/kernel development.
Here, we are not promising to cover the entiry of the field.
Our hope is to take you through the basics and show you enough to go on your
own.
Though, if you come up with an interesting problem do please contribute it
:smile:.
This is mostly for knowledge-sharing and for the thrill of discovery and
science.

With that, let's get going :rocket:.
